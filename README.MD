# Overview

As a software engineer, I am building a personal software portfolio to strengthen my programming skills and document my progress. This project is the starting point for my journey, helping me set up my development environment and establish good practices for future modules.

This software is a simple program that prints "Hello World" to the screen. It serves as a foundation for more complex projects and ensures my tools are configured correctly.

The purpose of this software is to verify my development environment and demonstrate my ability to create, document, and share code using industry-standard tools.
